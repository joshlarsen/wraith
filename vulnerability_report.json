The affected packages are libraries used by resource servers (builders) so this is most likely a direct dependency for those projects. The advisory explicitly states it does not directly affect keys, smart contracts, or funds; no detail is provided about RCE, DoS, or privilege escalation, so the most conservative impact category consistent with a generic SDK vulnerability is data confidentiality (potential information disclosure).
